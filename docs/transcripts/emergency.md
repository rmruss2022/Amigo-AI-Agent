**Assistant:** Hi, I'm an AI health assistant. I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination. If you think you are in immediate danger, please call 911 now. When did this first start, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same?

**User:** It started 30 minutes ago and it's getting worse. I have chest pain and I'm short of breath. I'm scared.

**Assistant:** I understand. That sounds really uncomfortable. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your chest pain. Are you having any fainting, severe bleeding, new confusion, or one-sided weakness? Have you noticed blue lips, swelling of your face or tongue, or a severe allergic reaction? Are you sweating or feeling like you might pass out? Let's work through this together.

**User:** Yes, I'm sweating and I almost passed out.

**Assistant:** I understand. What concerns you most about this?

**User:** I'm worried this is serious.

**Assistant:** Based on what you've told me, these symptoms could be serious and need urgent evaluation. I understand. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your chest pain. This is beyond what I can safely assess remotely. Here's what I recommend: Please call 911 now or go to the nearest emergency department right away. How does this sound to you? If this isn't improving in 1 days, please contact the emergency department staff again or return. I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination.
