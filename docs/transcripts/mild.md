# Mild Symptoms Transcript

**Assistant:** Hi, I'm an AI health assistant. I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination. If you think you are in immediate danger, please call 911 now. When did this first start, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same?

**User:** It started yesterday and is staying the same. I have a mild headache and I'm worried about it.

**Assistant:** I understand. That sounds really uncomfortable. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your headache. Please share any other details that feel important. Are you having any chest pain, trouble breathing, fainting, severe bleeding, new confusion, or one-sided weakness? Have you noticed blue lips, swelling of your face or tongue, or a severe allergic reaction? Do you feel your symptoms are suddenly getting much worse? Let's work through this together.

**User:** No to all of those. It's just a mild headache and some tiredness.

**Assistant:** I understand. What concerns you most about this?

**User:** I'm concerned it could get worse.

**Assistant:** I understand. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your headache. Based on what you shared about your headache, here are some self-care steps:
1. Rest and drink water, and keep meals light as you can. How does this sound to you?
2. Use a cool or warm compress on your head or neck, whichever feels better. How does this sound to you?
3. Use a pain relief medicine you have used before, like Tylenol or Advil, if it is safe for you. How does this sound to you?
If this isn't improving in 3 days, please contact a local clinic or urgent care.
If you develop chest pain, trouble breathing, confusion, fainting, or severe bleeding, seek emergency help right away.
