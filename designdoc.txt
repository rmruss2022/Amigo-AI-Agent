# Agent Engineer Take-Home Assessment Doc

## **Background**

You've been tasked with designing an AI system that can independently conduct primary care consultations, replacing the need for a human physician in routine cases.

## **The Challenge**

**Map out the key parts of a typical primary care appointment flow and build a prototype that can handle these flows.**

Your AI should be able to handle two types of patient scenarios:

- **Mild symptoms** (fatigue, headaches, minor issues)
- **Emergency symptoms** (chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe symptoms)

## **Deliverables**

### **1. System Design Document**

**Task**: Map out the key parts of a primary care appointment and design how your AI will handle them.

**What to cover**:

- The essential flow of a typical PCP appointment
- How your AI handles mild vs. emergency scenarios differently
- When and how the AI escalates to human care
- Patient experience and interaction design

### **2. Working  Prototype**

**Task**: Build a functional prototype that demonstrates your design. Your system instructions should be 500 words maximum.

**Requirements:**

- Handle both mild and emergency scenarios
- Demonstrate when to treat vs. escalate
- Create a natural, comfortable patient experience

**Linguistic Constraints:**

- Must use "I understand" (not "I see" or "I hear") when acknowledging patient concerns
- Never use medical jargon - replace with specific lay terms (e.g., "high blood pressure" not "hypertension")
- Always ask "What concerns you most about this?" before providing recommendations
- End every recommendation with "How does this sound to you?"

**Empathy Protocols:**

- When patients express worry, respond with "It's completely understandable that you're concerned about [specific symptom]"
- For pain descriptions, always validate with "That sounds really uncomfortable"
- Never say "don't worry" - instead use "let's work through this together"

**Structured Response Format:**

- Emergency assessments must follow: "Based on what you've told me..." + assessment + "Here's what I recommend..." + specific action
- For mild symptoms, always provide exactly 3 self-care recommendations numbered 1-3
- Must ask for symptom timeline in this exact format: "When did this first start, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same?"

**Safety Language:**

- All escalations must include: "This is beyond what I can safely assess remotely"
- Must state exact timeframe for follow-up: "If this isn't improving in [X days], please contact..."
- Include specific disclaimer: "I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination"

### **3. Validation Plan**

**Task**: How would you test this system before deploying with real patients? Assume you have infinite resources and could apply any theoretical testing approach or framework.

**What to include:**

- Your systematic testing approach and framework
- How you would measure safety and effectiveness
- What would convince hospital administrators this is ready for patients

## **Submission Format**

### **1. Design Document**

Cover your approach to the core challenge. Structure however makes most sense to you.

### **2. Working prototype + Documentation**

- Link to your prototype or video
- 2 actual conversation transcripts (one mild scenario, one emergency scenario)
- Your actual prompts (within word limits)

### **3. Validation Plan**

Your systematic approach to testing this before patient deployment.

### **4. Brief Reflection**

- What were the key limitations you faced in this challenge?
- How would you enhance the system to address those limitations?
- What surprised you about building this system?
